# School

This is my first microservice app for online-school that I created during the 1-month [course](https://stepik.org/course/117212/promo)

Stack: NestJs, RabbitMQ, MongoDB.

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. It will launch docker-compose file and `nx serve`
